# Shipment List Challenge

First of all, weâ€™d like to thank you for choosing Loadsmart. As a next step in the recruitment process, we have an exercise for you.

This is an opportunity to demonstrate your front end skills. Just be clear and do it to the best of your ability - the faster you complete it, of course, the quicker we can move forward.

## Goal

Your goal is to create a web app that allows users to see the details of a shipment from a list. Check the wireframes at the bottom of the page for reference.

## Solution

### Requirements

- Your submission will be evaluated using the latest version of Google Chrome
- You can use Javascript or Typescript, the standard project is only supported by Javascript for Typescript add the necessary dependencies
- CSS-in-JS (e.g. Styled components, Emotion) or CSS preprocessors (e.g. Sass or Stylus) are allowed
- Your UI must match the wireframes
- Your solution should be adaptable to support dynamic content (For example, more than 100 shipments on that list)
- Write Unit tests. You decide what to test
- Keep the tests running using `$ yarn test`
- Your solution should provide a *responsive version*
- Please include a DECISIONS.md file containing all information about the decisions you've made. For example, library X was used because of this, tested layer Y because of that, used Z architecture, etc.
- Please DON'T use any UI components (e.g. React Material-UI or Twitter Bootstrap)
- Please DON'T reuse any code from Loadsmart's website
